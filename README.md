# PennDash – Restaurant Recommendation Website

# Motivation :
The motivation behind PennDash Project stems from the growing demand for accessible, personalized dining recommendations, as highlighted by recent trends in the restaurant industry. With 94% of diners researching restaurants online before visiting and 79% preferring customized suggestions, there’s a clear need for platforms that provide tailored dining information and intuitive user experiences (Zippia; Restaurant Dive). PennDash meets this need by offering a Pennsylvania-specific platform that allows users to explore and save their favorite dining spots, filter based on key preferences like cuisine, location, and rating, and discover trending restaurants through Yelp’s extensive dataset. The platform’s Google Maps integration ensures easy navigation, while secure login provides a personalized and reliable user experience. By connecting locals and visitors to their ideal dining options, PennDash enhances the way people discover and engage with Pennsylvania’s vibrant culinary scene, offering an impactful, timely solution rooted in real-world demand and industry insights.
